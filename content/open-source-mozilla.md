Title: Collaborating in mozilla projects

This last week I've been working on different projects at the
[mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla/) repositories in github.

I enjoy working with other people in open source projects that I
believe have a positive inpact. This is the case of the projects I had
the oportunity to work on.

The one I'm more proud about is a little tunning I did to a `struct`
used to create json request to an API. This is the
[commit](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/commit/62785bce709f1d5481c97ef1fca355311d818b9a). The
reason I'm so proud about this one is that this one is my first **rust**
commit to a project that is not mine. 

Rust is a lenguage that I've played with earlier but never seriously
and during this time at home I've been more serious with it.

Also I made a couple of contributions to
[domain_utils](https://github.com/mozilla/domain_utils). As far as I
know this library is being used in some serious projects and my help
was good.

Lastly I cuntributed to
[bugbug](https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/commit/a6e24cbe14be323ec0efa9f1d492d201e5da4231)
a project to use AI to improve how mozilla handles bug reports. I'm
happy with this one because let me learn something new, the `struct`
module in python.

If you want to contribute to mozilla and don't know where to start I
recommend you [this page](https://codetribute.mozilla.org/) where you
can filter by labels, for example `good-first-issue`.
