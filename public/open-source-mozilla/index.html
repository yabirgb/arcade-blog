    <div class="markdown"><p>This last week I've been working on different projects at the
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/">mozilla</a> repositories in github.</p>
<p>I enjoy working with other people in open source projects that I
believe have a positive inpact. This is the case of the projects I had
the oportunity to work on.</p>
<p>The one I'm more proud about is a little tunning I did to a <code>struct</code>
used to create json request to an API. This is the
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/commit/62785bce709f1d5481c97ef1fca355311d818b9a">commit</a>. The
reason I'm so proud about this one is that this one is my first <strong>rust</strong>
commit to a project that is not mine. </p>
<p>Rust is a lenguage that I've played with earlier but never seriously
and during this time at home I've been more serious with it.</p>
<p>Also I made a couple of contributions to
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/domain_utils">domain_utils</a>. As far as I
know this library is being used in some serious projects and my help
was good.</p>
<p>Lastly I cuntributed to
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/commit/a6e24cbe14be323ec0efa9f1d492d201e5da4231">bugbug</a>
a project to use AI to improve how mozilla handles bug reports. I'm
happy with this one because let me learn something new, the <code>struct</code>
module in python.</p>
<p>If you want to contribute to mozilla and don't know where to start I
recommend you <a href="https://codetribute.mozilla.org/">this page</a> where you
can filter by labels, for example <code>good-first-issue</code>. </p></div>
